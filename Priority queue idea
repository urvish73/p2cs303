Heres an idea : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19535644/how-to-use-the-priority-queue-stl-for-objects
Scroll to the 3rd answer. it starts with : A priority queue is an abstract data type that captures the idea of a container whose elements
have "priorities" attached to them. 


From this example i had an idea.
We should have a class CompareEmployees
it will have a function similar to the example in CompareTime

The priority we need to compare would look like

class CompareEmployee {
    public:
    bool operator>()(Employee& 1, Employee& 2)
    {
       if ((1.get_waiting_time()-1.get_retaining_time()) > (2.get_waiting_time()-2.get_retaining_time()))
               return true;
       return false;
    }
}

we should change our private variable queue<Employee> emp; to priority_queue<Employee> emp; We might need to change the fillEmployee function
i just dont know if you can set a priority_queue emp = to a regular queue like we are currently doing.
