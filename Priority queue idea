Heres an idea : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19535644/how-to-use-the-priority-queue-stl-for-objects
Scroll to the 3rd answer. it starts with : A priority queue is an abstract data type that captures the idea of a container whose elements
have "priorities" attached to them. 


From this example i had an idea.
We should have a class CompareEmployees
it will have a function similar to the example in CompareTime

It seems me will need to change a couple things to fully implement a priority queue but for now just wanted to share this info
since i think our priority queue should look similar to it.

void book::fill_employees(queue<Employee>& employeeQueue)
{
    emp = employeeQueue;
}

priority_queue<Time, vector<Time>, CompareTime> pq;

edit the fill_employee to maybe read something like : <employeeQueue, queue<employeeQueue, CompareEmployee> emp;
