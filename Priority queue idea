Heres an idea : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19535644/how-to-use-the-priority-queue-stl-for-objects
Scroll to the 3rd answer. it starts with : A priority queue is an abstract data type that captures the idea of a container whose elements
have "priorities" attached to them. 


From this example i had an idea.
We should have a class CompareEmployees
it will have a function similar to the example in CompareTime

It seems me will need to change a couple things to fully implement a priority queue but for now just wanted to share this info
since i think our priority queue should look similar to it.

void book::fill_employees(queue<Employee>& employeeQueue)
{
    emp = employeeQueue;
}

priority_queue<Time, vector<Time>, CompareTime> pq;

The priority we need to compare would look like

class CompareEmployee {
    public:
    bool operator()(Employee& 1, Employee& 2)
    {
       if ((1.get_waiting_time()-1.get_retaining_time()) > (2.get_waiting_time()-2.get_retaining_time()))
               return true;
       return false;
    }
}
