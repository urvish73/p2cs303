The project should create an object named Library.
Library will have 2 lists of Books, Archived and Circulating
Library will also have a list of employees/users

Create an object Book that saves the data for each individual book.
Each book is initalized with a queue of Employees/Users

When Library calls the function circulate_book(Book)
the book will move from Archived to Circulating and will be pasased 
to each person in the queue until its empty then it'll be archived.

I think we need to understand priority Queues better so heres a link http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue
